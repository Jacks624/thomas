Bump_Placments.jpg shows where the bump maps have been applied...not everywhere as you can see.

Material_Settings.jpg shows how the material is set up in max. I have set the bump slider to 100, as out of all the material settings, this one always defaults to 30 for some reason, so.....for no reason other than keeping it uniform, I set it to 100....lol.

Seetings_NormalMap.jpg shows the settings I use to cnvert a grayscale image to the dot3 map. I set scale to 5, and that seems ok...but have a nose.... :O)
